# text-CRDT-experiment-automerge-ts

Small experiment project to test out [Automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge) text features to 
see if it would be a usable for the core data structure of an offline first syncing text editor.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
